PerlVision is a Perl 5 class library that enables you to implement an
attractive and versatile text-mode interface for your application
programs on Unix. It contains support for most common input elements
as well as for dialog boxes with arbitrary combinations of input
elements.

To use PerlVision you will need at least Perl 5.000, available from
ftp.netlabs.com and prep.ai.mit.edu, among other sites, and William
Setzer's Curses interface to Perl, available from ftp.ncsu.edu in
/pub/math/wsetzer.

The perlvision-0.1.0.tgz file should contain:

PV.pm		- The PerlVision module.
PerlVision.doc	- Documentation for PerlVision.
rap		- (rap ain't pico) A simple text editor as an example
                  of using PerlVision.
COPYING		- The GPL - terms and conditions under which rap (but
		  not the rest of PerlVision) is distributed
README		- This file.
IAFA-PACKAGE    - The IETF FTP Archives Working Group standard format 
                  description of PerlVision.

PerlVision is not public domain or copylefted software. If you plan to
use PerlVision or anything derived from it in any product that will be
sold commercially, you must obtain my prior written or PGP-signed
consent.

If you just want to use RAP, install Curses.pm and put PV.pm in your
Perl lib directory, typically /usr/lib/perl5 or /usr/local/lib/perl5,
put rap in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin, change the first line in rap to
point to where your Perl5 binary is installed, and you're all set. RAP
_is_ copylefted software.
